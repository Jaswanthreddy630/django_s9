    The last one year has taught us how important it is to be healthy. The coronavirus pandemic was a rude shock for everyone and it reminded everyone that it is extremely important to be healthy. People need to follow a well-balanced diet as well as work out. To follow a healthy routine, one needs to know their body type. Every person has a different body type and hence they cannot be asked to follow the same diet or exercise schedule. Moreover, it is not enough to know just your bodyweight; one has to be aware of their body mass index (BMI). The online Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator is a perfect device to determine that. The BMI calculator measures how much body mass you have according to your height and weight. Body mass refers not only to the fat within your body but also within muscles and bones. It is calculated by considering your weight and dividing it by the square of your height. This is a useful and easy tool for getting to know different weight categories that may lead to health problems.
