Mental health is a vital and necessary component of health. As per World Health Organisation (WHO), mental health is not just the absence of mental disorders or disabilities, it is more than that. Mental health is a state of wellness in which an individual recognises his or her own abilities, adapts coping with the regular stresses of life and can work productively.  According to The Global Burden of Disease Study (1990â€“2017), one in seven Indians were affected by mental disorders of varying severity in 2017 and the proportional contribution of mental disorders to the total disease burden in India has almost doubled since 1990. Hence, it is high time that we focus on increasing and creating awareness about the need to take care of mental health issues
